2012/03/17:
	* Make behavior more consistent with framerate (scaling movement
	  to framerate a bit, but just slows down if you go under 15fps,
	  and not bothering to update if it hasn't been at least 10ms).

2012/03/07:
	* When toggling on, add a ball if there aren't any.

2012/03/06:
	* More bug fixes galore for scoring mode.
	* More bug fixes for bounces.  Bouncing should seem more
	  intuitively correct now, and moving balls should never appear
	  to fly through a brick.
	* And propagate those fixes to the movable case.
	* Don't make the shadow smaller than the ball, it doesn't really
	  help.

2012/03/05:
	* Turn off colors as they didn't work well.
	* Scoring mode
	* Fix bugs in scoring mode.

2012/03/04:
	* Start new toy!
	* Turn off debugging messages.
	* Multiple balls
	* Friction and gravity settings
	* Improved graphic
	* Disable mouse masking
	* Fixups for collisions losing velocity, improvements to
	  starting motion.
	* Mouse gravity
	* Colors!
	* Strata fixed.
