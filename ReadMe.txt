GoofBall is just an amusing gimmick:  It adds a ball which bounces around the
screen and bounces off the cursor.  Why?  Because.

Also:
	/goofball -a	Add a ball (cap 25)
	/goofball -b	Add scoring mode!
	/goofball -d	Drop a ball
	/goofball -f #	Friction (100 = pretty sticky, 0 = frictionless)
	/goofball -g	Gravity, y/n?
	/goofball -m	Mouse gravity (attracts towards mouse)
	/goofball	Toggle

SCORING MODE:

	In goofball -b mode, a ball will occasionally appear which doesn't
	move, and which has a number on it, which counts down from 300.  If
	one of the balls hits it, you score the number of points shown,
	divided by the number of active balls.  If the mouse hits it, you
	lose 300 points.
